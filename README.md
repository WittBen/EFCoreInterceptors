# EFCoreInterceptors

This repository contains examples of how to implement and use interceptors in Entity Framework Core. Interceptors allow developers to monitor and manipulate the execution of database commands, enabling advanced logging, query optimization, or auditing in EF Core applications. The project demonstrates how to create and apply interceptors without the need for external libraries like Autofac, making it a lightweight solution for extending EF Core functionalities.

## Features
- EF Core Interceptor examples
- Logging and query manipulation
- Autofac-free implementation
